# Measures

I am from a UK family originally, and most of these recipes are Scottish.
Therefore, "imperial" measures will usually be UK, not US. 

## Volume

1 UK imperial pint = 1.2 US imperial pints

| UK measure             | US measure               | Metric                    |
+------------------------|--------------------------+---------------------------|
| 1 UK pint              | 1.2 US pints             | 0.57 litres               |
| 1 UK gallon            | 1.2 US gallons           | 4.5 litres                |

## Weights

Fortunately, US and UK points weight are the same, around 454 grams. 
However, UK recipes tend to measure more 
ingredients by weight, where US recipes very often use cups (i.e., volume),
especially for ingredients like flour and butter.
Personally, I prefer measuring by weight, especially for baking. It is so
much easier to slosh in flour by weight than to measure it
in cups.
