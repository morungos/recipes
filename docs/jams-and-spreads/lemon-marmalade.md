# Lemon marmalade

> From my grandmother's recipe book. “With the Compliments of the Cambridge 
> Electric Supply Company Ltd., to all members of the Kitchen Front Club”

## Ingredients

* 6 lemons
* 6 pints of water
* Sugar

## Method

Peel thinly and shred the lemons. Remove pith and pips, place in muslin and tie. 
Leave juice, lemon peel and water with pips etc. overnight if possible. Boil 
steadily for 2 hours or until thick, then weigh the liquid. To each pint of 
liquid add a pound of sugar and boil for 20 minutes. Remove -- allow to cool 
slightly, then pot and seal.
