# Gluten-free vegetarian haggis

> Adapted from [a recipe from The Pesky Vegan](https://thepeskyvegan.com/recipes/vegan-haggis/)

This is a personal favourite, and it's one of the best matches
to "real" haggis in texture and flavour. Leftovers work great 
when fried as sausages or burgers. And it makes an excellent 
"haggis supper" deep-fried in batter with potato fries. 

## Ingredients

* 200g of dried beluga lentils (or a 400g can of cooked beluga lentils)
* 250g pinhead oats
* 2 medium carrots, peeled and grated
* 150g finely chopped mushrooms
* 20 g butter
* 1 tsp ground pepper
* 1 tsp ground nutmeg
* 1 tbsp nutritional yeast
* 400 ml vegetarian stock
* 30 g sunflower seeds, chopped

## Method

Cook the lentils (if dried, alternatively, use a 400g can of beluga lentils 
if they are easier to find). I use an instant pot, cooking the lentils for 5 minutes 
with 2 cups of water. Melt the butter and cook the grated carrots for 5 min. 
Add the chopped mushrooms and cook for another 5 min. Mix in the lentils, 
white pepper, and nutmeg. Add the pinhead oats, nutritional yeast, and 
vegetarian stock, and cook for 15 mins. It should get thick and sticky, 
but add more water if needed. Turn off the heat and mix in the chopped 
sunflower seeds. Put in a pan, bake in a preheated oven at 360°F (180°C) 
for 30 mins. To crisp up, turn heat up for the last few minutes. Allow 
to stand for 5 mins, serve with tatties and baked beans.
