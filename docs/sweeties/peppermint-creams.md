# Peppermint creams

> From my grandmother’s recipe book.

## Ingredients

* Whites of 2 eggs
* As much icing sugar as will form a stuff paste
* A few drops of peppermint

## Method

Mix well and roll out to ¼ inch thickness. Cut in small rounds and 
spread on sheets of paper to set in a refrigerator. Ready the next day. 

**Note**:  Please don’t use raw eggs for this recipe. Either use 
pasteurized egg whites, or pasteurize them yourself.
