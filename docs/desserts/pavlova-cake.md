# Pavlova Cake

## Ingredients

* 3 egg whites
* 6 oz caster sugar
* 1 level tsp cornflour
* 1 tsp vinegar

## Method

Whisk whites until stiff. Whisk in half of the
sugar, fold in the second half of the sugar mixed
in with the cornflour. Mix in the vinegar.

Shape into a round on parchment paper, or on a tin,
or in a tin. Bake in a very low oven (Regulo 1, 275Â°F) 
for one hour.

Turn upside down to cool. Fill with whipped cream
and fruit -- best of all is fresh pineapple.
