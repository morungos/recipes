# Butteries

Butteries, or rowies, or even "morning rolls", are a traditional Aberdeenshire
roll, generally salty and fatty. They were common for the trawler
workers, because they were more immune to sea air.

They are particularly good warmed up and served for breakfast
with butter and marmalade.

This recipe makes 24 butteries.
