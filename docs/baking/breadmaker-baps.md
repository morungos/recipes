# Baps (using a breadmaker)

This recipe makes 8 baps.

## Ingredients

* 300ml water
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp sugar
* 30g white vegetable shortening
* 500g white flour
* 1 1/2 tsp instant yeast 

## Method

Put the water into the breadmaker tin, then add the salt 
and the sugar. Next add the flour, and the chopped 
vegetable fat. Finally add the yeast. Use the "dough"
program to mix and run a rise, for 90 minutes.

When done, turn out the dough onto a floured countertop
and shape roughly into a sausage shape to make it easy
to divide. Divide into 8, shape each into a rounded 
flattened disc, and then lay out on a baking tin lined 
with parchment paper, so they almost touch. Cover in
cling film and allow to rise in a warm place for another
90 minutes or so (I use an oven with the light on).

Close to the end of the second rise, pre-heat the 
oven to 450Â°F. Remove the cling film, dust the tops 
of the rolls with a little flour, and bake for 10-15 minutes,
until golden brown on top. 

When done, lift the parchment paper onto a cooling rack,
and gently separate at 15 minutes,
