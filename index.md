# A collection of old family recipes
{: .fs-9 }

This is a collection of old family recipes, transcribed from books owned by my grandmother 
and my mother. My grandmoher was the daughter of a relatively well-to-do baker, who 
at one time ran a bakery on Aberdeen's Union Street. 

These recipes include many dating back to the Second World War, so some of them are 
historically quite intriguing, especially in their selection of ingredients. Not all
of them have been tested, for several reasons: first, I'm actually vegetarian, so
I don't eat meat anyway; and second, some of the ingredients are almost impossible to
get today. 

As is usual in British recipes, especially until recently, the recipes themselves
are extremely brief: usually a list of ingredients and a method, occasionally
even the method is dropped. 

Note that oven temperatures in many of these recipes uses the "Regulo" or "gas mark" scale,
and some of the older ones are even more informal than that.
