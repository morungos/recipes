# A collection of old family recipes
{: .fs-9 }

This is a collection of old family recipes, transcribed from books owned by my grandmother 
and my mother. My grandmoher was the daughter of a relatively well-to-do baker, who 
at one time ran a bakery on Aberdeen's Union Street. 

These recipes include many dating back to the Second World War, so some of them are 
historically quite intriguing, especially in their selection of ingredients.
