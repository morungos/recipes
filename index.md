# A collection of old family recipes
{: .fs-9 }

This is a collection of old family recipes, transcribed from books owned by my grandmother 
and my mother. My grandmoher was the daughter of a relatively well-to-do baker, who 
at one time ran a bakery on Aberdeen's Union Street. 

These recipes include many dating back to the Second World War, so some of them are 
historically quite intriguing, especially in their selection of ingredients. Many 
were explicitly intended as "economical" for use with rationing. Rationing in the
UK lasted officially until the mid 1950s, but some foods, and especially cheese, 
were not in plentiful supply for decades after. 

Not all
of these recipes have been tested, for several reasons: first, I'm actually vegetarian, so
I don't eat meat anyway; and second, some of the ingredients are almost impossible to
get today. One example of this is "Protose" -- an early vegetarian meat substitute
made primarily from peanuts and wheat gluten -- but there are several others. And a 
frw ingredients, such as malt extract and golden syrup, are distinctively European enough
that they can be hard to find in North America. 

As is usual in British recipes, especially until recently, the recipes themselves
are extremely brief: usually a list of ingredients and a method, occasionally
the method is significantly abbreviated, or even entirely absent.

Note that oven temperatures in many of these recipes uses the "Regulo" or "gas mark" scale,
and some of the older ones are even more informal than that.
