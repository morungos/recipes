# Temperatures

The recipes use a wide assortment of temperature measures, so it
is worth including a conversion table.

The oldest recipes simply used qualitative descriptions, like
"hot", "moderate", and "cool"/"slow". This evolved into the "Regulo"
(or "gas mark") measure, before the more modern recipes, which
used a mixture of both Celsius and Fahrenheit. 

The gas mark scale was still in fairly wide use as recently as
the 1970s and 1980s. 

The scales compare as follows:

| Regulo/Gas mark | Fahrenheit | Celsius | Description               |
+-----------------+------------+---------+---------------------------|
| 1⁄4             | 225        | 107     | Very slow/very low        |
| 1⁄2             | 250        | 121     | Very slow/very low        |
| 1	              | 275        | 135     | Slow/low                  |
| 2	              | 300        | 149     | Slow/low                  |
